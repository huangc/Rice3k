creating distance maps for a given protein and cultivars

there are ~55K genes, or ~66K proteins annotated in the genome

there are ~3000 cultivars

all of  this information makes for a 55Kx3Kx3K tensor

the distance could be hamming distance or better yet described by PAM/BLOSUM etc established scoring matrix
